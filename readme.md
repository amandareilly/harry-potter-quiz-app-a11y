No a11y violations found with axe.  All needs review items were related to the software being unable to determine the background color of the .container due to the background-image.  I sampled the background image color (#1B1B1B) and ran it through the color contrast analyzer at https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/3.0/color-contrast?application=AxeChrome, which determined that it was compliant.
